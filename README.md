## Deep Learning- Computer vision projects
* [Mammogram breast-cancer detection]()
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model to predict whether a patient undergoing mamogram has cancer or not. Over 54000 mammograms in dicom formats were processed.
* [Colon cancer detection-histological_slides](https://github.com/lchudal89/portfolio_projects/blob/main/Computer_vision/colon_cancer%20prediction/coloncancer-training.ipynb)
In this project, CNN  deeplearning framework keras and tensorflow were used to develop a image classification method  histological slides of colon cancer biopsy were 
* [NFL player contact's detection](https://github.com/lchudal89/portfolio_projects/blob/main/Computer_vision/NFL_players_contact_detection/Contact-detection-kaggle.ipynb)
Kaggle competitoion- In this kaggle competition, I developed a model to predict the external contact experienced by players during NFL football games, using video and player tracking data to improve player safety Final rank: top 18% (165/939)


## Machine learning
* [Hypothetical SpaceX launch prediction]()
* [Fraudelent credit card transaction prediction](https://github.com/lchudal89/portfolio_projects/blob/main/Machine_learning_projects/Credit-card%20fraud%20detection.ipynb)

* [Housing price prediction]()
## Natural Language Processing
* [Movie_recommendation_system]()
* [predicting content recommendation system](https://github.com/lchudal89/portfolio_projects/blob/main/Natural_language_processing/curriculum-recommendation-system.ipynb)
The goal of this competition is to streamline the process of matching educational content to specific topics in a curriculum. I will develop an accurate and efficient model trained on a library of K-12 educational materials that have been organized into a variety of topic taxonomies. These materials are in diverse languages, and cover a wide range of topics, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).
Developed a personalized curriculum recommendation system using NLP techniques for more than 50 languages, resulting in enhanced learning experiences and outcomes for students around the world.Implemented word preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, lemmatizing, and lowercasing to prepare content for analysis. Conducted experiments with various filtering approaches, such as language, creator, format, and hierarchy, to improve the accuracy (F2-score) and efficiency (run time) of the system. Utilized Python and NLP libraries (including NLTK and spaCy) to calculate cosine similarity between content topics.Ranked among the at top 16 out of over 1050 teams on the efficiency leaderboard.
